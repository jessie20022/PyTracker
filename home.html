      <h1>A way for you to track your circadian rhythm</h1>
      <p>
        PyTracker is a webapp that will allow users to log and track their daily
        sleep hours and use a reaction time test to determine whether or not
        they should take a nap.
      </p>
      <h2>FEATURES</h2>
      <p>
        PyTracker will do many things for you. To begin, you'll be able to log
        into your account, which will track all of your data that you wish to
        enter.
      </p>
      <p>
        By logging your sleep hours, PyTracker will be able to tell you show you
        your average hours slept, the median, least amount slept, most amount
        slept, and more! You can also choose to view your data annually or
        monthly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to logging your hours, you can take a reaction test. Once
        you take multiple tests at your prime energy, your data will be
        recorded. Any time you want to strengthen your scores, you can take the
        reaction test again. If you feel tired, you can take the reaction test
        and it will tell you whether or not you should sleep.
      </p>
      <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
      <p>
        We've created this webapp in order to help those who are curious about
        their sleep habits. PyTracker, written in Python, provides detailed
        statistics about one's sleep habits for free! Jessica, one of the
        founders, had logged her hours of sleep for over 1.5 years. Her idea to
        implement this webapp was not only to fulfil her curiousity of seeing
        her statistics, but also make it easier for her to see her sleep habits.
        William, our second founder, thought this was a great idea and joined in
        to help bring this webapp to others. Both founders are undergraduate
        students at the University of Maryland.
